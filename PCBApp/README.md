# PowerConnection Broadcast
Repo created to keep a bunch of mini-projects that uses specific funcionalities (for my personal future refs)

This mini-project was only created as a personal reference,
be free to use it, post your own solution, share, comment, feedback, etc.

## PowerConnectionReceiever00.java
This BroadcastReceiver seems to have trouble with the POWER ACTIONS.
It always returns a != CHARGING status (Not necessarily a NOT CHARGING status)

## PowerConnectionReceiever01.java
This BroadcastReceiver seems to have work fine with the POWER ACTIONS.

Although, both broadcasts were tested in an Android 9 device (Galaxy Note 10)
and the device is not reporting a CHARGING/NOT CHARGING status. I guess it's
associated with the SDK initial config.
